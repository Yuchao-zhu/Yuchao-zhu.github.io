  description: Bioorthogonal chemistry has provided revolutionary chemical biology and biomedical research tools, including 
  cutting-edge techniques in cell labeling, antibody modification, high-throughput sequencing, and proteomics. However, most 
  bioorthogonal reactions are limited to two-component conjugation reactions and their diversity and application range must be 
  expanded. 
  This part of the research focuses on: a) Developing new bioorthogonal reactions. Based on the background of developing organic 
  chemical reactions during the doctoral period, I plan to design and verify a series of new reactions from the perspective of reaction catalysts, 
  initiators, ring stain, new reaction groups, and selectivity, especially reactions with higher reaction rates, milder reaction conditions, and 
  better biocompatibility; b) Applying new reactions in peptide modification. We will apply the developed bioorthogonal reactions to peptides to 
  achieve skeleton and PTM derivatization and evaluate modified peptides' biological activity and function changes
