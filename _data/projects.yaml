  description: Biocompatible chemistry has provided revolutionary chemical biology and biomedical research tools, including cutting-edge techniques in cell labeling, antibody modification, high-throughput sequencing, and proteomics. We plan to design and verify a series of new reactions from the perspective of reaction catalysts, initiators, ring stain, new reaction groups, and selectivity, especially reactions with higher reaction rates, milder reaction conditions, and better biocompatibility; b) Applying new reactions in peptide modification. We will apply the developed bioorthogonal reactions to peptides to achieve skeleton and PTM derivatization and evaluate modified peptides' biological activity and function changes

  description: Directed evolution is a powerful technique that accelerates the natural evolutionary process in vitro or in vivo through iterative cycles of genetic diversification and screening or selection. We will tirelessly pursue the development of advanced directed evolution techniques, integrating the latest advancements in high-throughput screening, continuous evolution, and computational modeling. Our goal is to create a robust and efficient platform that can rapidly identify and optimize proteins with therapeutic potential.
