Researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have successfully functionalized nanodiamonds using our innovative decarboxylative azidation reaction. This single-step method directly grafts azide groups onto low-cost nanodiamonds through silver-mediated decarboxylation and radical substitution. The resulting materials achieve high surface group loadings (up to 0.85 mmol/g) and can be further modified for diverse applications. This technique simplifies nanodiamond synthesis and enhances their potential for use in biomedical imaging and advanced materials.
