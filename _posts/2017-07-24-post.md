The innovative synthesis route for memantine, an important drug used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease developed by our research team has been highlighted by Prof. Craig Lindsley, the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (JMC), in ACS Chemical Neuroscience. This method stands out as one of the shortest known routes for memantine synthesis, significantly streamlining the process and enhancing efficiency
