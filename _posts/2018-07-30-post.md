Researchers have achieved a major breakthrough in organic chemistry by developing a silver-catalyzed method for directly functionalizing the δ-Csp3-H bonds in simple aliphatic alcohols under mild conditions. This innovative approach enables selective modification of inert Csp3-H bonds without pre-activation, offering excellent regioselectivity and a broad substrate scope. The method simplifies the synthesis of valuable functionalized alcohols and has the potential to transform organic synthesis.
